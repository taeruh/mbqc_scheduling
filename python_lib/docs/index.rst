Welcome to the documentation of mbqc_scheduling
===============================================

**This is a wrapper around the** `mbqc_scheduling crate`_.

How to read this documentation
------------------------------

Since this is just a wrapper the documentation is sometimes very sparse and we mostly
refer to the documentation of the underlying `mbqc_scheduling crate`_. If something is not
documented here, it's probably documented there..
