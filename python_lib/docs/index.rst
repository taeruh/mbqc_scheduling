Welcome to the documentation of mbqc_scheduling
===============================================

**This is a wrapper around the** `mbqc_scheduling crate`_.

This package is usually used to further analyze Pauli tracking results, provided with the
`pauli_tracker`_ package, in the context of Measurement Based Quantum Computing (MBQC).

How to read this documentation
------------------------------

Since this is just a wrapper the documentation is sometimes very sparse and we mostly
refer to the documentation of the underlying `mbqc_scheduling crate`_. If something is not
documented here, it's probably documented there..
