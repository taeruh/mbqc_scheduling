Welcome to the documentation of mbqc_scheduling
===============================================

**This library extends the** `pauli_tracker package`_ **with a wrapper around the**
`mbqc_scheduling crate`_.

How to read this documentation
------------------------------

Since this is just a wrapper the documentation is sometimes very sparse and we mostly
refer to the documentation of the underlying `mbqc_scheduling crate`_. If something is not
documented here, it's probably documented there. However, most of the things regarding
scheduling should be documented here and only the things regarding the Pauli tracker are
sparsely documented since they are documented in the `pauli_tracker crate documentation`_
(cf. `this documentation`_).
